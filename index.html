                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
                It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
                it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
                College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
                from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
                literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections.

                <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure 
                and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, 
                and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
                of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it 
                is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally 
                encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who 
                loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but 
                because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him 
                some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious 
                physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to 
                find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
                or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?" Section 1.10.33 of "de 
                Finibus Bonorum.
